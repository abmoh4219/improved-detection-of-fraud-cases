# Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the 10 Academy Week 8 project focused on improving fraud detection for e-commerce and bank transactions. The project follows the guidelines outlined in the Week 8 module and aims to develop a systematic workflow from data analysis to model interpretation.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**
  - **`raw/`**: Contains raw datasets (`Fraud_data.csv`, `IPAddress_to_Country.csv`, `creditcard.csv`).
  - **`processed/`**: Stores processed datasets (`cleaned_fraud_data.csv`, `merged_data.csv`, `featured_data.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and reporting.
  - `eda.ipynb`: Contains Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing.
  - `Interim_1_Report.md`: Detailed report for Interim-1 Submission.
  - `purchase_value_hist.png`, `purchase_value_by_class.png`: EDA visualizations.
- **`src/`**: Directory for source code (to be populated in later tasks).
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files to ignore (e.g., `data/processed/`, `*.pyc`).
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing project overview.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).

## Interim-1 Submission
- **Focus**: Confirm initiation of data analysis and understanding of datasets (Task 1).
- **Date**: July 22, 2025 (submitted late due to scheduling; awaiting tutor guidance).
- **Contents**: 
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  - EDA insights with visualizations.
  - Feature engineering details (time-based features, transaction frequency, geolocation).
  - Class imbalance analysis and proposed SMOTE strategy.
